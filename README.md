Project from the first year at uni, got low score on code clarity, now i see why

The task was to create a simulation of restaurant using threads and storing data
about menu and employees in txt files

After running code we can modify menu, employees and place orders

Opening the restaurant starts a seperate thread that deals with preparing orders so that we can still interact with the main window

While the restaurant is open we can check orders made, still pending as well as earnings and of course all the activities from the main window

The restaurant wont close until all the orders are finished
